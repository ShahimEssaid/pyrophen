Welcome to the documentation for pyrophen!
##########################################


The goal of the pyrophen is to generate a FHIR Code system for representing the
`Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <https://hpo.jax.org/app/>`_. pyrophen is used by
the HPO build system to generate the ``hp_fhir.xml`` file with every release, and
end users do not need to use or know anything about pyrophen. However,
we have made the `pyrophen code base <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/pyrophen>`_ and
this documentation public in the interest of transparency and to elicit feedback from
interested parties.
